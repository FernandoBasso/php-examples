= User Select Timezone

This example allows the user to choose a timezone, and the the date and time is
displayed according to that.

We used H instead of h for time so that, for instance, if America/Sao_Paulo is
7:40, Japan is 19:40 instead of 7:40 as well, since they are exaclty 12 hour
away from each other. It will just make the output easier to understand.

Also, Lybia is incorrect, and should be Libya. The goal is to show how to
handle the exception raised by attempting to create a DateTimeZone object with
an non-existing timezone.

To make the example stick to what is the bare minimum to make it work, we are
not redirecting after the form submission. That causes a problem that if the
user refreshes the page, the form is submitted again. Should we redirect after
submit, we would have to find other means to persist the selected timezone
after the redirect. Perhaps in the future we can make an improved version of
this example.
